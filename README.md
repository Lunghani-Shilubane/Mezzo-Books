# Mezzo Books
For the novice to skilled readers out there, this is the app that will help you connect with your favourite library, Mezzo books.
We have come up with this app to help all readers find what they're looking for in a short space of time, whether at home, where you can order the book of your choice 
or at the library, where you can use the app to find exactly what you're looking for without the hassle of searching the whole place for hours.

### Navigation style
The navigation style used on this app is not very common, but it is still very effective for getting around.
I used a simple back button at the top left corner of the screen so the user can navigate backwards from page to page, 
and I also included the buttons, which are basically the forward navigation. Once a button is clicked, the user will be led to the next page.
It's a simple way to get around and for the user to get to where they need to without any frustration.
